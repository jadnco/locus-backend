# Locus Backend

The repository serves as the backend API for the Locus app. Everything is written in ES6+, so Babel is used to transpile into ES5.

## Getting Started

The API uses MongoDB, so make sure its installed.

Run a new instance of MongoDB:
```sh
sudo mongod
```

Start running the server:
```sh
npm start
```

The API listens onto a *dynamic* IP address for development. This address will be given after running the above command.

## Development

Flow is being used to allow for statically typed JavaScript, make sure it is installed globally.

After creating new methods, run the following command and deal with any output properly:

```sh
flow
```

No unit or integration tests have been written yet, however they will be using Mocha and Chai.

To run unit tests:

```sh
npm test
```

## Production

Since ES6+ is not understood natively, a transpiled build needs to be created before pushing to a live production server. To create this build, run the following command:

```sh
npm run build
```

This command will generate a new `build` directory with files in ES5.
